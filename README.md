PREDICTING USER SWITCHES TO RENEWABLES IN AGE OF CONSUMER ENERGY CHOICE

By Michael Niamehr and Masuma Mansur

This project will explore the following two sets of factors involved with energy choice:
* Logistics: net generation of renewable electricity, retail price of electricity overall, retail price of renewables electricity, and temperature.
* Socioeconomics: attitude toward renewables, income.

** Note that the following simplifications were made: only PV is considered within renewables and political affiliation is acting as a substitute for attitude toward renewables.

In this code the following will be done:
* Simple manipulation on the data to bring it into a usable form and handle missing data
* Binary classification and evaluation of performance using accuracy
* 10-fold logistic classification and evaluation of performance using accuracy and various metrics
* SVM using linear, polynomial and RBF kernels and evaluation of performance using accuracy
